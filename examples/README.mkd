# Examples for Tracy integration

These examples exist to demonstrate how to integrate the rust-Tracy API within an application.
They do not serve as examples of a real world application, but rather how an application would use a given API.

To use them, run `cargo run -p tracy-client-examples -- example_name` from within the repository root.
If you don't provide an `example_name`, it will list the available examples.

Be sure to have Tracy running and awaiting a connection, before running any example!
